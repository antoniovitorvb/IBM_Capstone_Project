## Introduction/Business Problem
If you wnat to start your own business of Coffee Shop in New York CIty, it is pretty hard to know where is the best place to do so. But not so hard when you use data to discover where is the best location with the adequate venues and population density.

## Data
The data used to analyze the problem will be found using the FourSquare location data to have access of NYC cafeterias, other venues and theirs frenquent costumers. The best place to establish your own business, I believe, is close to the venues that people who frequently drinks coffee goes. The idea is to unite the data of most popular neighborhoods and  and its venues to trace where would those people, your persona, goes. And therefore, you'd have better advantages having a good poplation and location.
